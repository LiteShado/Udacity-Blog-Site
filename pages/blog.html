              Let's talk about motivation, and how we are supposed to keep ourselves
              pushed to the limits EVEN during the most challenging moments of our
              lives. I find that it is always fulfilling to figure out what is slowing
              me down by meditating and journaling my thoughts. There's a way to tap
              into one's innermost desires by allowing yourself to listen to your own
              ideas. Sometimes, you need to unplug from the wo rld around you and not
              get carried away in the rush of your environment. I truly feel that the
              physical feeling of stress is our body's way of speaking to us and
              letting us know we need to get in touch with our spirits.<br /><br />
              I love to meditate, it's where I feel the most necessary epiphanies lie.

          <p class="intro">
            Where there's a will, there's a way. I'm truly enamored by the sheer concept of Willpower, and what it means to maintain one's own drive even in the face of adversity. I'm someone who thrives and drives herself to be the very best I can be, and in that, I've done quite a bit to remain accountable to my own actions and habits. I truly understand the system of thought that says "habits create destiny", because it's the daily habits that will make or break your ambitions. You have to be able to build a momentum in order to get to where you desire to be in life.
