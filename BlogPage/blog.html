              Let's talk about motivation, and how we are supposed to keep ourselves
              pushed to the limits EVEN during the most challenging moments of our
              lives. I find that it is always fulfilling to figure out what is slowing
              me down by meditating and journaling my thoughts. There's a way to tap
              into one's innermost desires by allowing yourself to listen to your own
              ideas. Sometimes, you need to unplug from the wo rld around you and not
              get carried away in the rush of your environment. I truly feel that the
              physical feeling of stress is our body's way of speaking to us and
              letting us know we need to get in touch with our spirits.<br /><br />
              I love to meditate, it's where I feel the most necessary epiphanies lie.
