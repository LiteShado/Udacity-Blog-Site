        <h1>Morning Motivation</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            Let's talk about <u>motivation</u>, and how we are supposed to keep
            ourselves pushed to the limits EVEN during the most challenging
            moments of our lives. I find that it is always fulfilling to figure
            out what is slowing me down by meditating and journaling my
            thoughts. There's a way to tap into one's <em>innermost</em> desires
            by allowing yourself to listen to your own ideas. Sometimes, you
            need to unplug from the wo  rld around you and not get carried away in
            the rush of your environment. I truly feel that the physical feeling
            of stress is our body's way of speaking to us and letting us know we
            need to get in touch with our spirits. I <strong>love</strong> to
            meditate, it's where I feel the most necessary epiphanies lie.
